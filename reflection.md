1. **Define CI and CD in your own words.**  
   Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository and automatically testing them to catch errors early. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) is the process of automatically preparing or deploying those tested changes into production so that software can be released quickly and reliably.

2. **Why is automation important in software development?**  
   Automation reduces human error, speeds up repetitive tasks, and ensures consistency across builds, tests, and deployments. It allows developers to focus more on solving problems and building features instead of manually checking or deploying code.

3. **How can CI/CD pipelines improve teamwork and software quality?**  
   CI/CD pipelines encourage frequent collaboration by integrating everyoneâ€™s work into a single project regularly. Automated testing and deployment ensure that issues are found early, reducing bugs in production. This improves trust, communication, and overall software quality.

4. **What challenges did you face while setting this up?**  
   Some challenges included configuring the pipeline correctly, dealing with dependency or version issues, and understanding how to link the repository with the automation tools. Debugging failed builds also required careful attention to error logs.
